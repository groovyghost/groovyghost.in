Regular expressions are used when we want to search for specific lines of text containing a particular pattern.Here are some of the basic regular expressions:

| Metacharacter | Description                                        |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| .             | Matches any single character except for a newline.|
| *             | Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding character or group. |
| +             | Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding character or group. |
| $             | Anchors the match at the end of a line.            |
| ^             | Anchors the match at the beginning of a line.      |
| \S            | Matches any non-whitespace character.              |
| \s            | Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline). |
| ?             | Makes the preceding character or group optional (zero or one occurrence). |
| [a-z]         | Matches any lowercase letter in the specified range. |
| [A-Z]         | Matches any uppercase letter in the specified range. |
| [A-Za-z]      | Matches any letter (both uppercase and lowercase). |
| [0-9]         | Matches any digit.                                 |
| \             | Escapes a metacharacter, allowing you to match it as a literal character. |
