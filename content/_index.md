Hi, Welcome to my personal website. In interwebz i go by the handle `groovyghost`

I'm pursuing a career as a cloud devops engineer and currently working at a Saas company in Chennai. I like to tinker with stuff around automation, monitoring, networking and containerization.

Outside of "tech-y" stuff, I enjoy watching anime and movies, playing video games and going for road trips. Also I'm a cat person.

This site serves as my knowledge base where I share my experience about technologies I'm interested in at the time, or how I'm learning and growing in my career, sharing knowledge along the way.
