## Basic syntax

```md
# Start a heading with one hash

## Start a subheading with two hashes

Paragraphs are separated by empty lines.

**Bold text** is wrapped in double asterisks,

_italic_ in underscores,

`monospace` in backticks.

    # Indented code block
    hello() { echo 'Hello'; }

A list of items:

- Each item is on its line
- Lines start with `-`

An ordered list:

1. The first item
1. The second item can start with `1.` too
1. Markdown handles the numbering for you.

```

Use triple backticks to create a code block in markdown

```language
your code goes here
```
````
